Arduino GPS Box

This repository contains the sketch used for the Arduino GPS box detailed on Imgur. See post here: https://imgur.com/a/OquUi

The sketch utilizes a NEMA parser so it should be be used with a baud rate of at least 9600 (preferably 12800) it order to prevent the buffer from becoming overloaded.

The 4D Systems uLCD 43PT is controlled by serial controls. Another display could be substituted in with proper implementaiton and libraries.

Please feel free to submit issues but since this project has long since been completed, I may not make corrections.
